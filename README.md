# Mediawiki-Azure-CI
This is intended for people who want to run small/medium sized wikis on Azure using Container Instances.

Base images are taken from https://hub.docker.com/_/mediawiki <br>
A few modifications are made to make it suitable for deploying on Azure as a stateless container. <br>
See the Image-mods.sh for details on the modifications.

# For installation instructions please see the project wiki
